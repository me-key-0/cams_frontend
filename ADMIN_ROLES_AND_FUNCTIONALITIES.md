## Role Overview

The CAMS system implements a hierarchical role-based access control (RBAC) system with the following administrative roles:

- **Admin**: Department-level administrators with comprehensive management capabilities within their assigned department
- **Super Admin**: System-wide administrators with global access and additional system configuration capabilities

Both roles have elevated privileges compared to regular users (Students and Lecturers) and can perform administrative tasks across multiple system modules.

## API Implementation Guidelines

### Authentication and Authorization

All admin operations require proper authentication and role verification:

```http
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
X-User-Id: <admin-user-id>
X-User-Role: ADMIN | SUPER_ADMIN
X-User-Department: <department-code> (for ADMIN role)
```

### Role-Based Access Control

#### Admin Role Restrictions
- Limited to operations within assigned department
- Cannot access other departments' data
- Cannot create other Admin accounts
- Cannot modify system-wide settings

#### Super Admin Privileges
- Access to all departments and global operations
- Can create and manage Admin accounts
- Can modify system-wide configurations
- Can access cross-departmental analytics

### Common API Patterns

#### User Management
```http
POST /api/users
GET /api/users
DELETE /api/users/{id}
GET /api/users/lecturer/{lecturerId}
```

#### Course Management
```http
POST /api/v1/courses
GET /api/v1/courses
PUT /api/v1/courses/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/courses/{id}
```

#### Batch Management
```http
POST /api/batches
GET /api/batches/department/{departmentId}
PUT /api/batches/{id}
DELETE /api/batches/{id}
```

#### Evaluation Management
```http
POST /api/users/v1/evaluation/session
POST /api/users/v1/evaluation/session/{sessionId}/activate
GET /api/users/v1/evaluation/analytics/department/{departmentId}
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- All admin operations must validate user role and permissions
- Department-specific operations must verify department access
- Sensitive operations require additional authentication

### Data Protection
- Admin access to student data must comply with privacy regulations
- Audit logs must be maintained for all administrative actions
- Sensitive information must be properly encrypted and secured

### Session Management
- Admin sessions should have appropriate timeout periods
- Multi-factor authentication recommended for admin accounts
- Regular password updates and security reviews
